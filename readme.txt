Add beautiful, interactive live charts to your blog!

== Description ==

IPU-Chart is a Wordpress shortcode to create many different chart types inside your blog or page. It works perfectly on large computer screens as well as on tablets and smaller mobile screens. The data to display can reside directly in the document or it can be fetched from a remote service.

IPU-Chart has many options to style a chart. Add your own color palette or use the functions to generate color palettes that come with the plugin.

= Features =

* Creates bar, line, pie, donut, scatter, bubble and world map charts
* Supports data in json, csv or tsv format (Excel, Numbers)
* Lets you enter the data directy in a blog or page
* Loads the data from a remote service (database)
* Updates the data automatically if desired
* Has many options to style a chart with css or built-in color functions 

With the [IPU-Chart Multi Series Extension](https://www.ipublia.com/downloads/ipu-chart-multi-series-charts-for-wordpress/) IPU-Chart supports also multi series charts.

= Usage =

To display a bar or line chart inside a post or page add a div element with an id (thatâ€™s where the chart will be rendered) and enter the template configuration inside the [ip4] shortcode.

Data defined inside the document:
<pre><code>
<div id="kcal" style="width:90%; font-size:0.8em"></div>
...

[ip4]{
    "template": ip4.barChart(),
    "parentElement": "#kcal",
    "data": {
        "reader": ip4.dataReader()
            .data([ {"x": "Apple", "y": 55 },
                    {"x": "Avocado", "y": 145 },
                    {"x": "Banana", "y": 95 },
                    {"x": "Grapefruit", "y": 30 },
                    {"x": "Kiwi", "y": 55 } ])
    },
    "d3": {
        "yLabel": "kilo calories (kcal)"
    }
}[/ip4]
</code></pre>

To display a line or pie chart just enter <code>ip4.lineChart()</code> or <code>ip4.pieChart()</code> as template.

Data refresh the data from an url every 20 seconds:
<pre><code>
<div id="kcal" style="width:90%; font-size:0.8em"></div>
...

[ip4]{
    "template": ip4.barChart(),
    "parentElement": "#kcal",
    "data": {
        "reader": ip4.dataReader()
                      .uri("http://example.org/kcal")
                      .interval(20000)
    },
    "d3": {
        "yLabel": "kilo calories (kcal)"
    }
}[/ip4]
</code></pre>
